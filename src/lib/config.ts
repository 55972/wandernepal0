    excerpt: "The first thing nobody tells you about the EBC trek is how emotional it feels...",
    content: `The first thing nobody tells you about the EBC trek is how emotional it feels. Day 9, standing on the moraine above Base Camp with Everest finally visible after days of cloud cover — I wept. Not from exhaustion (though that was very real), but from the sheer, overwhelming immensity of what stood before me.

The Khumbu Icefall groaned and cracked like a living thing. The Sherpa guides are the true heroes of every Himalayan expedition. Our guide, Dawa, seemed to draw energy from the altitude, always smiling, always pointing out a peak or a monastery I would have walked past.

The tea houses along the route are cosy refuges — dal bhat (lentils and rice) has never tasted so extraordinary as it does at 4,000 metres. Pack your layers. The nights are brutal even in October, and altitude sickness is no joke — acclimatise properly and ascend slowly.

But do go. EBC will reset something in your soul.

Tips for future trekkers:
- Train for at least 3 months before
- Bring a good sleeping bag (rated to -15°C)
- Hire a porter — it supports the local economy and makes your trek enjoyable
- Don't rush — the journey is the destination
- Carry chocolate and energy bars`,

    content: `Nothing can fully prepare you for the Pashupatinath ghats. Arriving at dusk, I witnessed the Aarti ceremony — priests in white robes swinging great lamps of fire in synchronised, hypnotic arcs as devotional music filled the air.

Across the river, orange-robed sadhus watched in silence. Nearby, a cremation pyre burned quietly on the ghat, and a family stood together in grief and ritual. What struck me most was not the grandeur of the temple but the ordinariness of eternity — how life, death, worship, commerce, and monkeys (many monkeys!) all coexist in this one extraordinary space.

I spent three hours just sitting on the opposite bank watching. Visit at dawn or dusk when the light turns the Bagmati golden and the atmosphere becomes profoundly contemplative.

Dress modestly, be respectful during ceremonies, and allow yourself time to simply be present. This is not a tourist attraction — it's a living, breathing center of faith and mortality.

The cycle of life and death that sits at the heart of Hindu philosophy is on full display here, yet there's no sense of morbidity — only acceptance, ritual, and the continuity of existence.`,

    content: `The alarm rang at 5 AM in Pokhara and I nearly ignored it. I didn't. By 5:30 I was in a wooden rowboat on Phewa Lake, my guide rowing silently through mist that lay on the water like a veil.

Then the sun touched Machhapuchhre and the entire Annapurna range blazed gold — a wall of fire and rock reflected perfectly in the mirror-still lake. No photograph has ever done it justice.

Later that day I paraglided off Sarangkot Hill. The take-off was terrifying and the flight — 30 minutes soaring with eagles over a lake and mountains — was transcendent.

Pokhara is the rare place that manages to be simultaneously thrilling and deeply peaceful. The evenings on Lakeside, sipping lemon ginger honey tea while watching the lights of the city shimmer on the water, are worth the entire journey to Nepal.

For the best experience:
- Book the first boat of the morning
- Stay at a Lakeside hotel with mountain views
- Try the local fish from the lake
- Don't miss the World Peace Pagoda at sunset
- Paraglide — it's one of the best spots in the world`,

I held my breath the entire time.

Chitwan is extraordinary not just for the megafauna but for the sheer density of wildlife. In a single morning game drive we spotted a sleeping leopard in a tree, a family of spotted deer, a gharial crocodile longer than our jeep, and a staggering variety of birds.

The guided jungle walk — on foot, just you and the ranger — gives you a completely different perspective: you begin to read the forest's sounds, its smells, its warnings.

Book an experienced naturalist guide; the difference in quality of experience is enormous. Stay at a lodge inside the park if possible — the early morning and evening game drives are when the wildlife is most active.

The Tharu cultural show in the evening was surprisingly good — their traditional stick dance is energetic and unique. And try the local fish from the Rapti River — it's delicious!`,

    content: `I am not Buddhist, but Lumbini moved me profoundly. There is a quality of silence in the sacred garden that is unlike any place I have visited — a silence that feels intentional, as if the very air holds its breath in reverence.

Monks in robes of every colour — saffron, burgundy, grey, brown — walked slowly between the trees or sat in meditation. Inside the Maya Devi Temple, looking at the ancient brick foundations and the marker stone, the sense of historical and spiritual weight was overwhelming.

Two and a half millennia of pilgrimage, prayer, and human longing converge at this single point. The lotus-strewn Pushkarini Pond gleamed in late afternoon light.

Children from a local school were visiting, their laughter bouncing off ancient stone. For all its solemnity, Lumbini is also somehow joyful — a place of beginning, not ending.

The international monasteries zone is fascinating — each country has built a monastery in its national style. The Chinese, Thai, Burmese, and German monasteries are particularly impressive.

Stay at least one night to experience the garden at dawn before the day-trippers arrive. The peace is palpable.`,

    content: `I arrived at Boudhanath on my third morning in Kathmandu, jet-lagged and slightly overwhelmed by the city. Walking into the plaza, I stopped dead. The stupa is simply enormous — far bigger than photos suggest — and its eyes seem to follow you with a calm, knowing gaze.

I joined the kora, walking clockwise with hundreds of others: monks muttering mantras, young monks on smartphones (a delightful contrast), old Tibetan women who have walked this path every morning for decades.

I found a rooftop cafe overlooking the stupa and spent two hours there watching the world circle below. At dusk, when the butter lamps are lit and the entire stupa glows golden, the atmosphere becomes almost unbearably beautiful.

Boudhanath is one of those rare places that changes you a little bit just by being in it. The surrounding neighborhood is known as 'Little Tibet' and has excellent Tibetan restaurants. Try the momos and butter tea!

The best time to visit is early morning (6-8 AM) when the kora is filled with devoted locals, or at dusk when the lamps are lit. Avoid midday when tour groups arrive.`,
